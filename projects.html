            <h5>What is it?</h5>
            <p><dfn>LaLaLounge</dfn> is a web application that is currently in process.</p>
            <p>The audio is one of the many type of sounds and music I listen to when I study.
                Hence, the idea is to create a website to play soft and melodic sounds according 
                to a specific location that the user might want. For example, a user might be working in 
                their dorm room, but finds it hard to focus since they usually study at a cafe and thinks 
                that they would focus more there. By using this website, users can imagine as if they are in a cafe
                and have sounds like baristas or coffee brewing added to the default melodic music.

            <p>The video shows a scene from Squid Game Season 2. In the scene, the characters can be seen playing a rather
                violent game of Rock-Paper-Scissor-MinusONE. This is a popular game in korea that my friends and I have started to play
                to increase the intensity of regular rock paper scissor. Therefore, my friend and I have decided to make it into a game 
                that others can play with their friends as well!
