            <Summary><code>Getting All Personal...</code></Summary>
            Computer Science has always been a <span id="highlight">love-hate </span>relationship for me. I love it when my work goes my way and I hate it when it doesn't. 
            It was a major that I had <del>impulsively</del> happily picked because it was a combination of things I had loved. Design, art, creativity, story, and interaction. 
            However, as a third year student, I have realized that only when I continuously work and am intraced in the process, do I appreciate more and more. 
            And to be able to work, I have gone through various emotions to increase my knowledge of developing. Even though this isn't typical, <ins>I'm sure I'm not alone</ins>, 
            so I wanted to share a quote that helps me through it all.
            <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5251-sometimes-you-wake-up-sometimes-the-fall-kills-you-and">
                “Sometimes you wake up. Sometimes the fall kills you. And sometimes, when you fall, you fly.”
